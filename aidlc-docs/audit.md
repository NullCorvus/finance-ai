### HU-001: Register

**Feature:** PB-001

**Story:**
> As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can start using the app.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I enter email + password + confirm password → account is created

- If the password is too short → I see an error message
- My password is never shown or stored in plain text

**Checklist: Setup**
- [ ] Docker Compose (api + postgres)
- [ ] Run schema.sql + seed data (roles, currencies, payment methods)
- [ ] Create FastAPI project structure
- [ ] Create Flutter project + apply mockup theme
- [ ] Write `docs/api-spec.yaml` (register + login + me endpoints)

**Checklist: API**
- [ ] POST /register endpoint (validate → hash → insert → return token)

**Checklist: UI**
- [ ] RegisterScreen (email + password + confirm password + register button)

**Story Points:** *(to be estimated)*

### HU-002: Login

**Feature:** PB-001

**Story:**
> As a returning user, I want to log in so that I can access my expense data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I enter email + password → I'm logged in and see the chat screen
- If the password is wrong → I see "Invalid email or password"
- If my token expires → I'm redirected to login
- I stay logged in until I log out

**Checklist: API**
- [ ] POST /login endpoint (find user → verify hash → return JWT)
- [ ] GET /me endpoint (validate token → return current user)

**Checklist: UI**
- [ ] LoginScreen (email + password + login button)
- [ ] Token storage
- [ ] Protected routes — redirect to login if no valid token
- [ ] Connect to API

**Story Points:** *(to be estimated)*

### HU-003: Receipt photo → AI extraction + categorization

**Feature:** PB-002

**Story:**
> As a user, I want to upload a photo of my receipt so that the AI automatically extracts the data — merchant, date, currency, payment method, total, and each item with its name, amount, and subcategory — and I can confirm, edit, or discard before saving.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The app opens the camera and captures the image
- The image is temporarily sent to the backend
- AI returns: merchant, date, currency, payment method, total
- AI returns each item: name, amount, subcategory
- purchase_reason and item_reason are optional
- User sees a confirmation card with receipt data
- User sees the list of extracted items
- User can edit business fields (merchant, date, total, items, etc.)
- User CANNOT edit technical fields (user_id, receipt_id, etc.)
- User can add or remove items
- User can Confirm / Edit / Discard
- If discarded, the temporary image is deleted
- On confirm, everything saves atomically (receipt + items + image + relations)
- On failure, nothing is saved (rollback)

## Sprint Plan

| Sprint | Features |
|--------|----------|
| Sprint 1 | Register (HU-001) + Login (HU-002) |
| Sprint 2 | Photo → AI (HU-003) |
| Sprint 3 | Audio (HU-004) + CRUD (HU-005) |
| Sprint 4 | Dashboard (HU-006) + Testing + Survey |
```

**AI Response:** Reviewed the workspace, persistent project graph, backlog, Scrum guide, scope, feature list, architecture, schema, stack, mockups, sprint plan, and task list. The request is a documentation/backlog refinement review, not an implementation change.

**Context:** Workspace detection and requirements completeness review for Scrum Poker readiness.

---

## Workspace Detection / Findings
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-25T00:00:00Z
**User Input:** "Review the backlog against the repository documentation and guides, check tasks and unresolved decisions, validate consistency, and assess readiness for Scrum Poker."

**AI Response:** Brownfield planning workspace detected. Existing project documentation and a persistent graph are present; no application code or prior AI-DLC state/audit artifacts were found. Review identified conflicting backlog versions, undefined stories, unresolved scope decisions, missing API specification, missing seed data, and a schema creation-order issue.

**Context:** Workspace detection completed; requirements depth assessed as standard for backlog refinement.

---

## Requirements Scope Clarification
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-25T00:00:00Z
**User Input:** "solo register and login ...."

**AI Response:** Narrowed the review and Poker scope to HU-001 Register and HU-002 Login only. Photo, audio, CRUD, dashboard, income, and spending limits remain future backlog items and are not required for this estimation session.

**Context:** Requirements scope clarification received after initial backlog review.

---

## Schema Clarification
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-25T00:00:00Z
**User Input:** "correjirr el orden de creacion en docs schema como asi ?? que pasa ??"

**AI Response:** Explained that the `user` table references `currency(id)` before the `currency` table is created, which can cause PostgreSQL schema initialization to fail. No schema file was changed in this interaction.

**Context:** Clarification of a pre-existing database schema ordering issue.

---

## Backlog Classification Clarification
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-25T00:00:00Z
**User Input:** "uan duda esto que cambia: contraseña mínima de 8 caracteres; Register devuelve JWT o redirige a Login; duración y expiración del JWT; logout borrando el token local; nuevo usuario con rol user y moneda COP. ¿Esto va como acceptance, user story o task?"

**AI Response:** Classified the listed items as decisions that refine existing user stories: acceptance criteria for observable behavior, non-functional/security requirements where applicable, and implementation/setup tasks for the technical work. No new feature story is required.

**Context:** Clarification of where authentication decisions belong in the backlog.

---

## Diagram Analysis Question
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-25T00:00:00Z
**User Input:** "Una duda me ayudas a ver que diagramas puedo hacer con la informacion que tengo en el repo que diagramas uml osea automaticmanete inferidos de la data que ya esta???"
**AI Response:** Performed workspace detection and analyzed all documentation sources (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/SCHEMA.md, docs/schema.sql, docs/ALCANCE.md, docs/FEATURES.md, docs/BACKLOG-AND-STORIES.md, docs/STACK.md, docs/mockups/, graphify-out/). Presented the UML diagram inventory that can be auto-inferred from existing data and asked which ones to generate. No files were changed.
**Context:** Advisory analysis question — no code generation requested.

---

## UML Diagrams Generation
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-25T00:00:00Z
**User Input:** "Generalo de todas maneras, peor primero dime cuales uml exiten y cuiales exigen en un proyecto y cuales pdoemos hacer ahora y cuales dberiamos hacer"
**AI Response:** Inventoried existing diagrams (SCHEMA.md classDiagram+erDiagram, ARCHITECTURE.md layer/component/2 DFDs, guide examples, graphify graph.html) and generated docs/UML.md with 8 new Mermaid diagrams: use case (User+Admin), class data model from schema.sql, activity (capture), state machine (expense lifecycle), deployment, and 3 sequence diagrams (register expense, login JWT, ask AI). All 8 blocks validated with mmdc 11.16.0 + Chrome (zero errors). Roles caveat documented: Admin per ALCANCE.md vs step5-plan Q1 exclusion.
**Context:** Advisory question escalated to explicit generation request; content validated per content-validation.md.

---

## Educational Question — Class Diagram
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-25T00:00:00Z
**User Input:** "QUE ES EL DIAGRAMA DE CLASES Class Diagram"
**AI Response:** Explained what a UML class diagram is (structural/static view: classes, attributes, methods, relationships), the notation (3 compartments, visibility symbols, multiplicities), relationship types, the three levels (domain/analysis/design), the difference vs ER, and how it applies to the project's docs/UML.md class diagram (data model level, no methods until code exists). No files changed.
**Context:** Educational clarification question.

---

## HU-003 Family Redefinition (Happy Path / Failure Path / Text Parse)
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T00:00:00Z
**User Input:** "q1. A / q2. A / q3. but how wee know if the recipt is blurry ?? / q4. I think a retro is enought / q5. C is best option / q6. A / q7I think is ok" — then "I think is all right save that vercion i think is good"
**AI Response:** Defined the HU-003 family per SPIDR Path split (guide §9): HU-003 photo happy path (photo-only scope; Editar opens the HU-005a form; post-save "✅ Gasto guardado" + clean hub; technical fields locked; optional reasons), HU-003a failure paths (unreadable = AI reports status:unreadable, no blur detection; partial extraction shown; backend fail → Reintentar; permission denied → settings shortcut + manual fallback; temp image cleanup 24h; atomic rollback), HU-003b text → AI parse (text field confirmed as AI-parse channel from mockup evidence — placeholder 'gasté 15 mil en almuerzo en Subway…', Enter triggers the same AI card; minimal receipt, no image). Fixed Sprint Plan to match locked manual-first decision (Sprint 2 = CRUD 005a/b/c, Sprint 3 = photo+text, Sprint 4 = audio+dashboard). Updated story count note (8 fully defined) and parked section (4 items resolved, 4 remaining). Cross-checked against ALCANCE.md, FEATURES.md, step5-plan.md, mockups, schema — no other files needed changes.
**Context:** docs/BACKLOG-AND-STORIES.md — user-story definition session, decisions logged with [Answer] format.

## Story Renumbering to Build Order
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T00:00:00Z
**User Input:** "but organize the numbers in order i mean like is it but with 1 2 3 login manual image"
**AI Response:** Renumbered all stories so codes follow build order: HU-001 Register · HU-002 Login · HU-003 Create manually (was 005a) · HU-004 Edit & delete (was 005b) · HU-005 Find/search (was 005c) · HU-006 Photo happy path (was 003) · HU-007 Photo failures (was 003a) · HU-008 Text parse (was 003b) · HU-009 Audio (was 004) · HU-010 Dashboard (was 006) — exactly 10 stories, meeting the teacher requirement. Applied via two-pass placeholder rename (no code collisions) to BACKLOG-AND-STORIES.md, MOCKUPS.md, FEATURES.md, mockups/index.html, menu-variants.html, input-variants.html. Replaced the old HU-005 epic block with a CRUD note, fixed all "Split of:" lines, rewrote top note with the old→new mapping, updated sprint plan/parked/decisions headers. Verified 0 stale references remain. Left untouched: audit.md (historical), index-backup.html (backup), docs/SPRINT-PLAN.md (older doc with its own numbering scheme — flagged to user as a separate cleanup task).
**Context:** docs/BACKLOG-AND-STORIES.md — numbering consistency pass across all docs.

## Requirements Analysis / Backlog and User Stories Review
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T20:58:11Z
**User Input**: "check if the backlog makes sense and the user histories are god based on the guide and all the other info in the repo"
**AI Response**: Began a brownfield documentation review of the backlog and user stories against the repository guides, architecture, schema, features, mockups, sprint plan, tasks, and project context. The review will assess story quality, consistency, missing definitions, dependencies, and Scrum Poker readiness.
**Context:** Requirements analysis and backlog refinement review.

---

## Requirements Analysis / Review Findings
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T21:02:02Z
**User Input**: "check if the backlog makes sense and the user histories are god based on the guide and all the other info in the repo"
**AI Response**: Reviewed the current backlog and stories against the Scrum guide, repository scope, features, architecture, schema, mockups, tasks, sprint plans, and project context. Findings: HU-001 through HU-008 have a useful user-centered structure, vertical dependencies, confirmation/error paths, and ownership rules, but HU-009 and HU-010 are still placeholders. The backlog is not ready as a complete Poker package because the Product Goal, Definition of Done, team/capacity assumptions, story estimates, and a single authoritative sprint plan are missing. Blocking consistency issues include manual/text input being defined both as AI parsing and direct manual save, and receipt totals being defined both as item auto-sums and as printed totals that may differ. The repository also contains a stale `docs/SPRINT-PLAN.md`, a schema creation-order defect where `user.preferred_currency_id` references `currency` before it is created, no seed-data file despite the backlog requiring seed data, and missing `docs/api-spec.yaml`. Income is in the scope/schema/mockup but has no user story, while dashboard scope is inconsistent between category-only analytics and income/balance/trend analytics. No backlog or application-code files were changed; only the required audit and state tracking were updated.
**Context:** Requirements analysis completed for a documentation/backlog readiness review; implementation is not authorized.

---

## Documentation Refinement / Implementation Request
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T21:33:18Z
**User Input**: "Implement the plan."
**AI Response**: Implemented the approved documentation refinement plan: synchronized the sprint plan with the current backlog, clarified manual versus AI-assisted text capture, documented source-dependent receipt totals, refined the active expense stories, and removed stale core-chat wording. Deferred database/API setup, Scrum preparation, audio definition, and dashboard definition as requested.
**Context:** Documentation-only backlog and user-story refinement.

---

## Documentation Refinement / Completion
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T21:48:04Z
**User Input**: "Implement the plan."
**AI Response:** Completed the approved documentation refinement. Sprints now match the active backlog; manual-form and AI-assisted text paths are distinct; receipt totals are source-dependent; HU-003 through HU-008 contain the selected behavior, failure, editing, contract, and upload decisions; core chat wording is removed; and admin is explicitly future scope outside the current core. Validation passed for story/sprint consistency, mockup JavaScript syntax, Mermaid architecture/schema diagrams, and `git diff --check`.
**Context:** Implementation and verification of the documentation-only backlog refinement; database/API setup, Scrum preparation, HU-009 audio definition, and HU-010 dashboard definition were intentionally deferred.

---

## User Story Task Checklists and Mockup / Completion
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T22:38:50Z
**User Input**: "Implement the plan."
**AI Response:** Added API, UI, Tests, and Mockup checklists for HU-003 through HU-008 in `docs/BACKLOG-AND-STORIES.md`. Updated `docs/mockups/index.html` and `docs/MOCKUPS.md` to cover manual direct-save validation, source-specific photo/text AI previews, edit-before-confirm, printed versus item-sum totals, date filtering, deletion feedback, and representative AI failure states. Normalized edited totals and validated the interactive flows with a headless browser smoke suite.
**Context:** Implementation of the approved task-definition and mockup-verification plan. HU-009 audio and HU-010 dashboard task definitions remain intentionally deferred; no application backend or frontend source code was added.

---

## Identity Foundation / GitHub Publication Requested
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-31T14:15:29.9739162Z
**User Input:** "go it , can you make a commit to the git hub in the cloud, or this branches to accept (i dono t remember the name of them, could you)"
**AI Response:** Created `feat/identity-foundation`, committed the complete UOW-01/UOW-02 implementation, merged the newest `origin/master` documentation changes, excluded local secrets and generated artifacts, and prepared the branch for a GitHub pull request.
**Context:** The requested review mechanism is a pull request rather than a direct push to `master`.

---

## Repository Separation Authorized
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-31T22:31:14.5918342Z
**User Input:** "so go ahead sweetheart"
**AI Response:** Accepted authorization to split the approved identity implementation into private `finance-ai-backend` and `finance-ai-frontend` repositories while retaining `finance-ai` as the documentation and project-coordination hub. The split will preserve history, independent CI, safe local orchestration, and a reviewable GitHub workflow.
**Context:** PR #1 remains a recoverable checkpoint until both new repositories and the documentation-only replacement are verified.

---

## Repository Separation / Local Completion
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-31T23:06:57.9560510Z
**User Input:** "so go ahead sweetheart"
**AI Response:** Preserved the backend and frontend subtree histories in standalone sibling worktrees, added independent CI and repository-specific agent guidance, verified backend quality and Flutter shared/native Windows tests, and converted the original branch into the documentation/orchestration hub. Updated active repository, stack, session, diagnostics, and local Compose guidance while retaining earlier monorepo answers as historical evidence. GitHub creation of `NullCorvus/finance-ai-backend` and `NullCorvus/finance-ai-frontend` remains pending because the authenticated `Maicol2363` account cannot create repositories in the `NullCorvus` owner.
**Context:** Local separation is complete and recoverable. The existing hub pull request can be updated now; publishing the two standalone histories requires the empty private remotes to be created by an owner with permission.
